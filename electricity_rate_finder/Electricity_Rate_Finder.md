# Electricity Rate Finder
  **Empowering people to understand their Electrity**

### 1. **Project Overview:**
  The Electricity Rate Finder is designed to make electricity costs transparent and easy to understand. Whether you're in a deregulated market choosing between multiple providers or in a regulated market wanting to know your current rate, this tool helps you see the big picture. With just a few clicks, you can compare rates, understand the source of your electricity, and make informed choices about your energy use.

### 2. **Mission Statement:**
  My goal with the Electricity Rate Finder is simple: to give people a clear and easy way to understand how much they're paying for electricity and where it’s coming from. I want to cut through the confusion and make it straightforward for everyone to compare rates, know what they're being charged, and make informed decisions about their energy use. This project is about solving a problem that affects all of us—bringing transparency to electricity costs and helping people take control of their energy choices.

### 3. **How It Works:**
  **As of now, there is no working version. These are simply placeholder ideas**
